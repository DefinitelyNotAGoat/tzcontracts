# Tz Contracts
We are working on various smart contract templates and standard, written in fi and compiled to Michelson. Some of our contracts are also ported to Liquidity where they make sense.

Our aim is to explore and produce smart contracts that are secure and either replicate an existing template/standard form another blockchain, or provide some other utility to the Tezos eco-system.
